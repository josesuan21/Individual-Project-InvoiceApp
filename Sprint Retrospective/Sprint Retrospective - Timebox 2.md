# Sprint Retrospective - Timebox 2

## Outcome

### Sprint Goals?
**Documentation**
* Started to create all list of Tickets for Timebox 2
* Arrange and assign tickets as Stretch Tickets as the size is too much to spend
* Created Spike tickets for preparing to research a ticket and stretch tickets
* Created BUG cards if found during development
* Update README file on Github
* Create Sprint Burndown Chart
* Demo to stake holder to get feedback and supervisor for guidance

**Project**
* Improving the invoice application by implementing the list of tickets for timebox2. Overall the these tickets main goal is:
    *  To improve the mechanism such as control and improve code architecture such as implementing MVP
    *  To implement Unit Test for ease of testing.
    *   Updating data (adding important data in the invoice, viewing and adding the data storage and avoiding data loss.)  
    *   Resizable form for Invoice form and Records Form
    *   Improve PDF layout to be presentable

## Timebox/Sprint Demo

Stake holder was satisfied with the new implemented tickets added especially the PDF layout.

Excellent and happy witht the demo - Supervisor.

## Reflection

### What went well

* Managed to implement all the focused tickets for timebox 2 that was promised for the stake holder.
* Be able to sort tickets and prioritised based on difficulty and engineering time to spend. This is an example of listing which of tickets for timebox are stretch tickets. 
* Adding Spike tickets to give the engineer some time to research functionalities that are new. This prepares the engineer whether the ticket can be implemented and be able to update the size if based on its difficulty. 
* Adding BUG tickets to remind the engineer there are changes that happened which would potentially could cause other tickets to be affected. 
* Using the task board and burndown chart to update the progress to ensure there are no missing tickets left.
* Commiting to the branch in Github everytime a group of tickets are finsihed for backup. 
* Organising task to add symbols for ease of understanding the behaviour of a card. 
* Provide good naming of tickets and adding comments for the code. 
* Implementing MVP architecture which I am able to manage code easily. 
* Being able to demo to the stakeholder and supervisor to gain useful feedback for improvements.


### What didnt go so well

* Spending too much time more than the expected engineering hours due to there are tickets that requires to add additional tickets. For example ticket 18, I missed that it should be able to select an item which I have to create ticket 18.1.

* Some ticket names and documentation are not properly written out as I tried to make sure to spend more time in developing and catch up with other work such as other modules.

* Some feature require data consistency to ensure the robustness of the application. 

* Not able to create diagrams for preparing the materials for the report.


### Ideas/Suggestions for next sprint/future


* Ensure ticket provide or shows improvement for data consistency. 
* List tickets that are important and ones that have less priority
* Ensure to ask more inforamtion to the needs of the stake holder in order to create or find tickets that is will be needed to be implemented. 
* 


## Action Points

* List All ticket for Timebox 3 and 4 and show to the user what to deliver in the end and give a name what is the purpose of the ticket. 
* Next timebox 3 is plan to 30 story points but be wary of how many hours you manage to work this through.
* Timebox 3 ensure that the user be able to deploy the program in the user's computer with initial user guide.
* Try to create a ticket that produces statistic to help the business to analyse its progress for ticket 3 or 4.
* Ensure to prepare documents and evidence of work for the final report.
