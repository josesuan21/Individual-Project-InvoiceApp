## Timebox/Sprint Demo

Stake holder was satisfied with the new implemented tickets added especially with the automated input text and Deployment.

Excellent and happy witht the demo - Supervisor.

## Reflection

### What went well

* Be able to implement all of the targeted tickets for timebox 3
* Be able to managed and sort which tickets are going to be planned to finish for timebox 4
* Writing down the sprint burndown chart to be able to track the progress. 

### What didnt go so well
* Not enough time to finish other main features which I decided to make it as a stretch feature due to other module. Which I only able to work this sprint for 1 week.
* Some new tickets are implemented during production requested by stake holder which changes the engineering time to spent.

### Ideas/Suggestions for next sprint/future

* Ensure to list down all the features by priorities so that the system is able to work well with expectation of the client. 


## Action Points

* Continue to finish Timebox 4
* Ensure to finish all the tickets with red labels followed by orange and green. 
* Start writing report after finishing all the important tickets for timebox 4
