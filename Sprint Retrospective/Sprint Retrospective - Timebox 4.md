## Reflection

### What went well

* Be able to implement all of the targeted tickets for timebox 4 (especially the red labels)
* Prioritised tickets and created a decision which tickets to be left.
* Writing down the sprint burndown chart to be able to track the progress. 
* Taken notes example of features that reuquires improvement:
    * Payment details (Creating its own table or application setup)
    * Statistics - Volume metrics
    * Service table - same table with new table boolean
* Creating Features was done in a professional settings - Trello and hack md 

### What didnt go so well
* Not enough time to finish other main features which some of the features I have decided to make it simple to be able to implement.(Service table created its own table)
* Some new tickets are implemented during production as they were missed out before starting timebox 4
* Automated testing was not covered and added more - this done because automated testing was not started on 1st Timebox, I started working on it on timebox 2.

### Ideas/Suggestions for next sprint/future

* Ensure to list down all the features and ensure to analyse and plan how to make a code more better for example service table. 


## Action Points

* Start to write report for my IP20 (dissertation) evidence of the project
* Finalise some the system and by implementing left features such as statistic report controlling volume metrics
* Prepare for presenation
