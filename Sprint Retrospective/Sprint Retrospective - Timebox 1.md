# Sprint Retrospective - Timebox 1

## Outcome

### Sprint Goals?
* Setup initial project structure and tickets
    * Creating a backlog of requirements
    * Ticket format/template
* Have buildable software to show to user
    * Milestone 1 is completed and committed
* Have stub project documented for additional developers
    * Startup and use - Can be found in the Github [ReadMe.md](https://hackmd.io/l4Rnry2HQmOzF1UrygD4XA) file 
* Start developing some features towards generating a pdf invoice
    * As this is out first sprint, we are assertaining velocity

## Timebox/Sprint Demo

Applause!
Excelenltly conveyed

"Showing the overall Tickets of the program from input, process and output actions"


## Reflection


### What went well

* Managed to at least implement the basic functionalities of the program.
* Within one sprint team has setup a good working structure. This an excelent foundation for future work! 
* Great Demo!
* Learned using new tools like Hack MD, more tool in Github and structure of the Tickets
    * Mermaid
    * Branches
    * Ticket Templates
* During meeting with the team (Allan) I always keep taking notes what to finish per each week
    * Execelent note taking
* Good agile process allowed for tickets to be creaed mid sprint (Although we should try to avoid this in future?)


### What didnt go so well

* Master branch did not hold the current version
    * "Defenition of done?"
    * Didnt properly commit main branch (Sometimes I forget)
* Development of features done in single branch?
    * Shall we keep with this approach? or more to discilined branch names? Pull requests?
* Setup instructions needed
* There were many tickets missed out during development and changes of tickets which causes to consume time. 
* The planning for achieving a particular ticket expectation is not guaranteed due to cost of having many holes found in each ticket. 


### Ideas/Suggestions for next sprint/future
* Ensure to check and analyse each ticket's detail to avoid missing out other tickets in the future. (Ticket discipline)
* Book dates in advance with the user to get feedback? 
    * Getting feedback to the end user, to see bugs or new features added
* How do we track research/exploration/spike tasks? (Types of tickets and  These are not 'sized' tickets)
    * Research/Exploration - new libraries, Check about spike ticket
    * Spike - Goal? Timeboxed? 1 Day (8 dev hours)
    * These will still require an Id same as Tickets
* How will we track bugs when the user reports them? 
    * Are these just tickets? Maybe BUG001?
    * Invalidates the COS of an existing ticket - Important distinction to a _feature request_
    * If the COS invalidates the ticket we considered it as a bug and we have to create new card BUG001
    * if the COS does not invalidate but found new holes, then it is a new Ticket
* Name tickets that is focused in the user not the developer +1


* Testing?
    * Create Automated testing
        * **Unit test project** in Visual Studio


## Action Points

* For Timebox2 Have set of sized tickets (worth 20 points) before starting the sprint/work/implementation
* Planning to start on 1st of March 2021
* Endevor to speicy tickets in advacne --- rewording
    * Improve Planning 
* Decide Branch stratery

    * Main branch
    * Invoice-App-(Finishing 1-Milestone)
    * Invoice-App-(Finishing 2-Milestone)
    * Invoice-App-(Finishing 3-Milestone)
* Tag tickets in the Task board to check which is High and Low priorities
    * [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/cx2xwnkH/df49ae2947e0e45b88522f4a3e404579/task-board-invoice-application)
* Create MOSCOW
