Ticket 003: Data Store
=======================

At the early stage of the development, the program requires a SQL Server database created for the invoice application project. This SQL server database will provide to create 4 relational database tables and use it to store important details of the invoices. 

This ticket is vital as other tickets will need to use it for inserting, selecting and updating records in the program. Also, it would used for future tickets that will create reports to analyse the business progress.

Coditions of Success
--------------------
*  Add a new item in the solution project and create "Service based database"
    *  Name the item as "InvoiceDatabase.mdf"
*  Create 4 tables
    * Customer
    * Service
    * ChosenServices
    * InvoiceRecord

* Use appropriate data type for each field 
    * (check technical notes for more information)
    
* Sample records - must have few sample records for testing and will be used for other tickets.
    * 2 sample records for customer and service tables. (Any kind of data)
    * 1 sample record for InvoiceRecord table. 
        (e.g. 1, 2000, 100, 0, Test Invoice Data, 11/02/2021)

Techical Notes
--------------
* Visual studio must have Visual C# item "Service-based Database"
* Use Visual studio Community 2019 Version 16.2.5

* Sample ServiceChosen table record


| serviceChosenId | serviceId | customerId | invoiceRecordId |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |
|     0     | 1     | 1     |     2000   |
|     1     | 2     | 1     |     2000   |
|     2     | 1     | 2     |     2001   |

The "a" is an alias that reference to InvoiceRecord table. This requires INNER JOIN statement to get the specific attribute of InvoiceRecord table, which is invoiceId. 

* Sample Query to get the specific customer on specific invoice record
```sql=
SELECT serviceChosenId, serviceId, customerId, invoiceRecordId

FROM ServiceChosen

WHERE customerId == 1 AND invoiceRecordId = 2000
```

| **2**    | To create the SQL server database and 4 tables for the solution project can be done quickly. The difficult part is learning how to connect the SQL database server into c# code and testing whether the tables do update. |
