# Individual-Project-InvoiceApp
 This project is to create a simple invoice application that will help my father's business and potentially for other small businesses. The business struggles to create invoices as the user uses traditional hand-written style with formatted template document. This consumes time and creates risk of writing wrong details in the invoice that decreases the business' performance.
  The creation for this application is an opportunity to be used for my final year study project and be able to learn and understand all the factors involved for software engineering.
