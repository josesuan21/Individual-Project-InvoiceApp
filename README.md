# Individual-Project-InvoiceApp
 This project is to create a simple invoice application that will help my father's business and potentially for other small businesses. The business struggles to create invoices as he uses traditional hand-written style with formatted template document. This consumes time and creates risk of writing wrong details in the invoice which decreases the business' performance.
